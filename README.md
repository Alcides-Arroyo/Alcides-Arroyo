- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Alcides-Arroyo
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in creating a code repository for those who want to consult it at any time.
This repository will contain the necessary ideas, concepts, and code needed to solve problems or create solutions related to various data topics.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning about new software because we need to know how to program our analytical techniques in another language. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: alcidesarroyo96@gmail.com
